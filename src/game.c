// This file contains everything related to reading controller input, handling
// the Pong game mechanics and using the graphics functions to draw the game
// state to the screen.
//
// To play the game, here are the controls:
// - Press + to pause/unpause the game
// - Use the up/down buttons on the directional pad to move the left paddle
// - Use X and B to move the right paddle
// - Use HOME to exit (Homebrew Launcher) or open the HOME Menu (app launched
//   from the Wii U Menu)
//
// A ball will be at the centre of the screen, and will bounce off the top/
// bottom of the screen. You must use your paddle to prevent the ball from
// moving off-screen, if the ball moves off your side of the screen, the
// opponent will earn a point.
