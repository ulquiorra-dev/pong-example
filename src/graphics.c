// graphics.c
//
// This file contains everything related to graphics and modifying what is
// shown on screen, as well as managing the memory for the screen contents.
// This is one of the more involved aspects of programming on the Wii U, as
// there is a lot of background information that must be understood.
//
// On the Wii U, there are two graphics systems - GX2 and OSScreen. GX2 is
// kind-of like DirectX or Vulkan in that it works by directly interfacing
// with the GPU in order to create 3D environments or smooth-running 2D games.
// OSScreen gives you a simple framebuffer in which you can only change the
// colour of individual pixels, one-at-a-time. It does also provide a method
// of displaying text on screen in a monospace font. Although OSScreen does
// not provide nearly as much functionality as GX2, it is much easier to use
// and understand, and so will be used in this example project.
//
// OSScreen provides two separate framebuffers for the TV screen, and two
// buffers for the GamePad screen. At any point, one buffer for each device
// will be displayed on-screen, and the other is being edited using the
// OSScreen functions. We'll call these the "display buffer" and "work buffer"
// respectively. Once the program has finished editing the work buffer, the
// buffers can be "flipped", such that the changes that were made to the work
// buffer are now being displayed on screen, and the other buffer can now be
// edited. So flipping is like asking the console to "render" all the changes
// you made. This is necessary because changing the display buffer while the
// hardware is trying to read the buffer would result in some old and some new
// data being displayed on screen, or other kinds of flickering or visual
// artifacts.
//
// The Wii U has multiple memory regions, and one of these is the MEM1 chip.
// It provides 32MB of fast RAM, perfect for storage of things like graphics
// framebuffers that may struggle with performance issues if stored on slower
// memory regions. The catch with using MEM1 is that it can only be used by
// one program at a time, and so when ProcUI transitions our app to the
// background, we must clear anything we have in MEM1 so that it can be used
// by other apps. Once our program moves back into the foreground, we can once
// again use MEM1. This is only a minor inconvenience because our program
// cannot draw to the screen while it is in the background anyway, and this is
// all we use MEM1 for.
//
// RAM operations are generally slow, and so in order to improve performance,
// modern processors include their own small memory regions that store
// commonly accessed data, such that RAM does not need to be utilised as much.
// This process is called caching, and is done with both data and instructions.
// However, the Wii U's caching model is not coherent, which means that
// information that gets stored in the cache may not be automatically written
// into RAM. The display hardware in the Wii U can only operate with
// information stored in RAM, and so if parts of our framebuffer get stored
// in the cache, the display hardware will not see the changes, and will show
// outdated information. I have never personally seen this happen, but to be
// on the safe side, during program execution we regularly flush the PowerPC
// data cache, which forces all changes that were stored in the cache to be
// immediately written to RAM, so that the display hardware is always working
// with up-to-date data.
//
// I know, that's a lot to take in. When I started programming, I struggled to
// understand a lot of this as well. Keep at it, you'll get there. :)

// This provides the ability to interact with the PowerPC processor's caching
// mechanism.
#include <coreinit/cache.h>

// This provides structs that can be used to map memory regions on the console.
// We use this to obtain a handle to MEM1 memory.
#include <coreinit/memheap.h>

// This provides functions that allow the creation of frame heaps, allowing a
// program to allocate and free memory in a particular region. Again, this is
// used to interface with MEM1.
#include <coreinit/memfrmheap.h>

// This provides access to the OSScreen family of functions, for creating,
// drawing to and displaying graphics framebuffers.
#include <coreinit/screen.h>

// This is used to provide callbacks to the ProcUI system that allow the
// program to automatically remove and re-allocate things in MEM1 when
// transitioning into the background and foreground, respectively.
// This functionality is not provided by WUT's ProcUI wrapper (whb/proc.h)
// and so must be implemented manually.
#include <proc_ui/procui.h>

// Provides access to the strlen() standard library function.
#include <string.h>

// Allows us to send messages through WUT's logging interface.
#include <whb/log.h>

#include "graphics.h"

// ProcUI asks for a "priority" value when creating callbacks - 100 is usually
// a good value for this, you may wish to use different values if you have
// multiple callbacks for the same event.
#define CALLBACK_PRIORITY     100

// With OSScreen, the framebuffer must be stored in memory with an address
// starting at a 256-byte interval. Otherwise, the buffer may not display
// on-screen correctly. This is seen in some older, unmaintained Wii U
// software, in which the contents of the screen are further to the right of
// the screen than they should be (so the buffer is not centred correctly).
#define FRAMEBUFFER_ALIGNMENT 0x100

// Frame heaps provide the functionality to set a particular 'state' for future
// allocations, giving the ability to later free all allocations made while
// in that state in a very simple manner.
// 0x504F4E47 is the hexadecimal representation of "PONG". :P
#define PONG_MEMORY_STATE     0x504F4E47

// Text is drawn to the screen in a monospaced (fixed-with) font, and so
// individual characters are aligned to a grid. On the GamePad, this grid
// covers the whole screen. A total of 69 (stop laughing) characters can be
// displayed horizontally across the visible screen area, from x-coordinates
// -4 (very left side) to 65 (very right side).
#define TEXT_CONSOLE_WIDTH    69
#define TEXT_LEFT_BOUNDARY    -4

// When removing the contents of MEM1, it helps to clear the framebuffers.
// Writing black to the buffers is an easy way to do this, as the HTML code
// for black is all zeroes.

// These variables are used internally by the below functions to determine
// whether or not the program has tried to initialize the library, and whether
